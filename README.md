The Light is Fading is a short piece of interactive fiction exploring Alzheimer's disease and memory loss, set mostly in the house of the point of view character, Sam, and their partner Robin. It is a text based  browser game
    that takes the player through about five days of in-game time, as Sam's memory progressively degrades.

**CHOICES**
The central mechanic of the game is that of choices. The player reads the text that appears, then picks the option that seems to them the most ideal one. Rinse and repeat until you arrive at the end of the story. 

**LAUNCH GUIDE**
The Light is Fading is _technically_ broswer based, however, in the absence of a server on which to host it, you're going to have to do that yourself. Luckily, it's also not very big, so I'm sure you'll be fine. 
1) Download the above files. 
2) Open the index file.


_The Light is Fading was developped using ink, Inkle's scripting language._

 This project was made for the interactive fiction class ( _Fiction Interactive_(2023A)) given by Isaac Pante (SLI, Lettres, UNIL). __
